# Genetic Algorithm Library for Python

Genetic Algorithm Library is a generic implementation of differents method to resolve genetic algorithm problems for Python. Currently working on Python 2.7.

You can :
  - Use different methods for filling the next generation.
  - Work with float or integer values, what best suits your problem.
  - Define your fitness function, to fit the problem.
  - Adjust almost all parameters of the algorithm.


Some history of the project
---------

This project started as a project for an university subject of bio-inspired computing, after the first work we started to think to public the project on GitHub and here we are. 



### Tech

Our library uses a few open source projects to work properly:

* PySide - For creating the User interface.

And of course the library itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/ibarbech/GeneticAlgorithmLibraryPython)
 on GitHub.
 

### Installation

Our library requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7.x to run.

Currently we haven't got a release, but we are working on it.
Anyways, you can download the content of the Master branch.

Install the dependencies.

```sh
$ cd GeneticAlgorithmPythonLibrary
$ sudo install.sh
```

If you can launch the script...

```sh
$ sudo chmod 557 install.sh
```


### User Interface

We currently offer a simple user interface for our example problem [TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).


We will try to offer a way to easy change the ui for visualization of the results.



### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Feel free to modify the code and submit a pull request, we will integrate it on the repository version.

You can contact us in our GitHub profiles :
- [Ivan Barbecho]  
- [Juan Pedro Torres]

### Todos

 - Example of use in a implementation
 - Release a stable version
 - Add Code Comments
 - Comparison between methods
 - Cython (?)
 - More improvements to come
