Currently working on Python 2.7.\r\n\r\nYou can :\r\n  - Use different methods for filling the next generation.\r\n  - Work with float or integer values, what best suits your problem.\r\n  - Define your fitness function, to fit the problem.\r\n  - Adjust almost all parameters of the algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome history of the project\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThis project started as a project for an university subject of bio-inspired computing, after the first work we started to think to public the project on GitHub and here we are. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tech\r\n\r\nOur library uses a few open source projects to work properly:\r\n\r\n* PySide - For creating the User interface.\r\n\r\nAnd of course the library itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/ibarbech/GeneticAlgorithmLibraryPython)\r\n on GitHub.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nOur library requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7.x to run.\r\n\r\nCurrently we haven't got a release, but we are working on it.\r\nAnyways, you can download the content of the Master branch.\r\n\r\nInstall the dependencies.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd GeneticAlgorithmPythonLibrary\r\n$ sudo install.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you can launch the script...\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ sudo chmod 557 install.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### User Interface\r\n\r\nWe currently offer a simple user interface for our example problem [TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will try to offer a way to easy change the ui for visualization of the results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\nWant to contribute? Great!\r\n\r\nFeel free to modify the code and submit a pull request, we will integrate it on the repository version.\r\n\r\nYou can contact us in our GitHub profiles :\r\n- [Ivan Barbecho]  \r\n- [Juan Pedro Torres]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n - Example of use in a implementation\r\n - Release a stable version\r\n - Add Code Comments\r\n - Comparison between methods\r\n - Cython (?)\r\n - More improvements to come\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n----\r\n\r\n[GPL-3.0]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[//]: # (These are reference links used in the body of this note and get stripped out when the markdown processor does its job.
